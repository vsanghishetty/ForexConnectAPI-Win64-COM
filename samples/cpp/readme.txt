ForexConnect C++ samples note:

C++ samples for the ForexConnect API use the threadlib library located
in ForexConnectAPI\samples\cpp\threadlib\ as source code and
precompiled binary file. For correct work of the samples, it is
necessary to recompile the threadlib library before compiling the
samples using the same version of Visual Studio.
